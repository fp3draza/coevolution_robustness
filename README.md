# Coevolution increases robustness to extinctions in mutualistic but not antagonistic communities

This repository hosts the code used in the manuscript *Coevolution increases robustness to extinctions in mutualistic but not antagonistic communities*. The directory is structured as follows:

- code: contains all code to run simulations, process results, and visualise output.
- figures: directory where all figures will be stored after running the appropriate script.
- input: directory where data used to parametrise simulations is stored. 
- output: directory where all raw output from simulations will be stored after running the appropriate script.
- results: directory where all processed output will be stored after running the appropriate script.

Note that each subdirectory contains a brief explanation of its contents. Please note that data is not stored here but can be found at:
