# Coevolution increases robustness to extinctions in mutualistic but not exploitative communities

This repository hosts the code used in the manuscript *Coevolution increases robustness to extinctions in mutualistic but not exploitative communities*. The directory is structured as follows:

- code: contains all code to run simulations, process results, and visualise output.
- input: directory where data used to parametrise simulations is stored. 
- output: directory where all raw output from simulations will be stored after running the appropriate script.
- results: directory where all processed output will be stored after running the appropriate script.

Please note that when running code, you may have to update paths to work on your machine. 

We are also providing the data used to generate all figures in the main text of the manuscript. This consists of an `.Rdata` file that contain the proccesed output of running the simulations. This data can be found here: https://github.com/fp3draza/coevolution_robustness/releases.
